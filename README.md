# React Router DOM Practice Project 🚀

This is a simple yet insightful project built to practice and explore the powerful features of **React Router DOM (v6+)**. It's not a portfolio site — but a hands-on experiment to understand and apply routing concepts in React.

## 📌 What This Project Includes

- ✅ Navigation between pages using `react-router-dom`
- ✅ Active link highlighting with `NavLink`
- ✅ Data fetching before page render using **Loaders**
- ✅ A dedicated `GitHub` page that fetches public repo count via GitHub API
- ✅ A `Contact` page with personal info
- ✅ A clean `Home` and `About` page for layout and content

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me deeply understand how routing works in modern React apps:

- 🌐 **SPA Navigation**: Switch between multiple pages without reloading the browser.
- 🔗 **NavLink Magic**: Automatically highlight the current active page.
- ⚡ **Loaders**: Pre-fetch data/API responses even before rendering the component, helping create optimized web apps.
- 🧱 **Route Structure**: Define nested routes and layouts for better code organization.
- 🧭 **useNavigate()**: Redirect users programmatically after events like form submission.
- 🚫 **Error Handling**: Set up a fallback route for undefined paths (`404 page`).

## 💡 Why This Matters

Understanding `react-router-dom` is essential for any React developer building scalable, user-friendly web apps. If you're just getting started, I highly encourage you to explore this library in depth and unleash its full potential.
